# Project_AODS


This project describes my replication research, which focuses on the paper ”Bag of Tricks for Efficient Text Classification” by Armand Joulin et al. My major goal was to reproduce the original research findings using the fastText model on a variety of datasets, including AG News, Yelp, and Yahoo! Answers. The significance of replicability in research is highlighted since it confirms the validity of key findings and methodologies. In my replication attempts, I rigorously followed the original evaluation framework, resulting in results that closely matched the success of the source research. In addition to replicating the original work, I also chose new datasets to investigate the fastText model’s adaptability. My findings not only support fastText’s efficiency and efficacy for text classification tasks, but also help to broaden our understanding of text classification approaches in natural language processing. Finally, this study analyzes the significance of our findings in the context of the original work, emphasizing the possibilities for future research and applications in the subject.
