Ok look, my coworker isn't that concious of customer service and yes he gave you the glare down - but you were taking FOREVER to seat us.  She said that we were \\\"next\\\" and then seated 4 other couples before us. Not to mention that the table we ended up sitting at was empty for no joke 15 minutes before we were sat there.  She obviously was doing it on purpose and the owners should fire her.  \\n\\nIt's your job to put on a smile and give the customers great service and she failed.  As for the food, my coworker got a foot long chili hot dog and liked it.  I got the spaghetti and meatballs and the meatballs are made with veal, pork and beef and are huge.  Very tasty.

We had some staff who were incredibly friendly and out going while our main waitress was gruffy and looked like she wanted to beat someone up but her mood seemed to lighten up towards the end.\\n\\nTheir gyozas were good, and I ordered their Ajo or garlic ramen as my main. If you love garlic, you will enjoy this dish as much as I do though I might not suggest this dish for a first date, unless you bring some gum! The portions are large, the meat/egg and vegetables were cooked fine, and the broth itself had dried garlic chips and a handful of whole garlic cloves so you will be all about garlic.\\n\\nThis was perfect for a cold night, and BYOB.\n",

I worked with several of there associates and each one was better than the last on the three projects I did around the house. (Pictures attached)\\n\\nThere follow through process of letting me know when the tile will arrive, if I received everything undamaged, and if I need to place an order for some follow-on pieces was exceptional customer service and something I never received from any other tile or designer store. As it turned out in two of my three projects with them, I did need to buy more tile as my contractor miss calculated twice. \\n\\nThey are definitely not a big box store like Lowes, Home Depot, or Arizona Tile. Craftsman Court is unique, one of a kind tile, from all of the world. If you want to come home to the same tile that anyone can get from any big box store all over the country, then this probably isn't the place for you.

      "Original Text: Think this was another instance where raving yelp reviews set my expectations too high. I think its a cute place, I have no problem w it being in a strip mall. I think its really odd to have a bar AND a bartender when you only serve beer and wine. Our server was nice, but nothing exceptional. We were waiting for another person to join us, so after getting our bread and drinks we were basically ignored until she showed up. I tried to wave down the waiter a couple times to order an appetizer but he just flew by. \\nThe freshly baked bread was great but like someone else mentioned, it was in sections and some were toasted to sh-t on the outside - basically big croutons. We started w the mussels which were just ok, definitely not worth $15 for 6 mussels w panko on top. It was an excessive wait until we got our salads. I went w the Caesar - awesome dressing w a kick to it.  I got the rigatoni w meatball. Huge portion of pasta and a big meatball for an additional $6. Great dish - pasta al dente, creamy cheesy sauce, meatball was tender and flavorful. Was it worth $25....I guess so? \\nI was a little miffed that I wasn't offered a free cheesecake like the majority of yelpers seemed to get, but whatever. I just had coffee instead which when we got the bill I found out was $4. Iced tea was also $4. My fault I guess for not looking at the bevg section, but I think its ridiculous to charge that much for a fountain drink and regular perculated coffee. \\nI'll probably be back someday, but I'm really disappointed in the overall experience. Food was good but pricey, service wasn't the best. Even if i didnt walk in w a preconcieved notion of what it would be like, I'd expect a small neighborhood place like that to have great friendly staff. Its nit picky but he didn't even tell us the daily specials which even crappy olive garden does. I meant to ask what French pork chops were but totally forgot by the time he came back.\\nToo bad it wasn't a better experience because I live close enough to have become a regular, but not based off this visit. I'd prefer to go to stratta for the whole dining experience and a full bar for the same price.\n",

What a disappointment -- virtually flavorless. Not what I'd expect of an IPA at all. Probably should have tried something else, but I just moved on.\\n\\nOh, and like other independent brewpubs in Montreal - cash only. Boo for the business traveler.\n",

      "Original Text: For this place getting all the hype that it does I was thoroughly disappointed.  I've lived in NYC and all over New England and this place is bunk compared to most places back there.  It's cool he makes his own cheese and all that but this place is not worth waiting in the long line for.  I was expecting it to be like Pepe's Pizza in New Haven, CT. where they also have long lines but it was not even close.  I like the frozen Trader Joe's pizzas better!  And it's super loud and crowded inside, the tables are really close together.  I've thought about giving this place another shot because so many people rave about it but I really don't want to.\n",

      "Original Text: I checked out this dealership on Yelp prior to visiting them as I found them online and was interested in a truck they had listed on Cars.com.  I read the Yelp reviews... some great, and some poor and decided I'd make a visit to see the truck even though they had some pretty bad reviews on here.\\n\\nI don't live in Vegas, but am in town right now for Pubcon (a Search Marketing conference) for the next few days.  I contacted them and let them know I wanted to set up an appointment with them on Wed. morning to see the specific truck I was interested in.  We scheduled the appointment a few days prior to me being in town.  I then called them Wed. morning about an hour prior to my appointment to confirm the appointment and to make sure the truck I wanted was there.  I let them know I'd be by in about an hour and was looking forward to seeing the truck.  Appointment confirmed.\\n\\nI show up at 9:45 am, about 50 min. after I called and am greeted outside by a sales woman.  She brings me in, sits down and asks my name, pulls up my appointment and then takes me over to see the manager.  The manager pulls up my appointment and says to me - \\\"oh, you're hear to see truck X, (not listing what I want so I don't get spammed here by other dealers) it's really nice.\\\"  She then calls over a salesman to take me over to the trucks location and show it to me.  I head out the door with him and after a hundred yards or so as we're heading toward another building he tells me that the truck I am interested in was sold yesterday.\\n\\nAt this point, I'm annoyed! not because the truck is sold, but because NO ONE told me that when they had a chance to save me the trouble and time it took to go there, check in, talk to the manager, etc.  I'm in town on business and making a trip out of my way to see this truck and they knew it was sold... so why keep my appointment? Why invite me in?  Why send me to the manager and a salesman?  Simple answer, they figured why tell him it's sold; let's just get him in here and see if we can sell him something else instead.  PROBLEM is that is a total waste of my time.\\n\\nInitially I thought, maybe they didn't know it had sold when we spoke on the phone to confirm the appointment???  Now that I've thought about it more, I don't buy it though and that's why I'm giving them a bad review here and I don't buy the manager telling me: \\\"oh, you're hear to see truck X, it's really nice\\\" and here's why.  After I spoke to the manager and she called over the salesman she wanted to help me, we walked right outside and began talking while walking toward the lot and on the way he told me the truck had sold.  He didn't have any paperwork to check on it, he didn't call anyone on the way, we didn't go to an empty stall and then he called someone and said, where is X truck at?  He just knew that I was there to see the truck and it had sold the day before.\\n\\nAnyway, after he told me the truck had sold I told him my visit there was a waste of time and that I wished they would have told me earlier, etc.  He quickly checked his inventory to see if they had anything else on the lot that was similar to what I wanted and they didn't and that was that, I left.\n",
